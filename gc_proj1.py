""" Intro to Python: Programming Project Week 1

Write a Python program which prints out a brief message 
containing your name and your previous programming experience,
each on a separate line.  Your program should then ask
the user for their name (use the input function for this).  
Finally, print out a welcome to the user, that includes their name.
