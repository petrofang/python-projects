""" Intro to Python: Programming Project Week 2:

You are to a program which calculates the amount of money spent 
during one visit to the Green Lantern Diner. Your program is 
to assume that you have ordered 4 items. 

The program is to:

Allow the user to enter the name of each of the items purchased

Allow the user to enter the cost of each item

Print out a list of all items purchased and the cost

Calculate the amount due for the purchased items and print this subtotal

Calculate the tax amount due, assuming that the tax is 10% 
and print out the amount of tax due

Calculate the amount of tip, assuming that the service was great 
and 20% will be left â€¦ and print the amount of the tip

Calculate and print the total amount that was spent at the Diner
